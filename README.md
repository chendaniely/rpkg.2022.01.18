- `init` and `clone` are one-time operations
- it's good to create a `~/git` folder for all your repositories
- `git push origin main`: sends the `main` code from your computer to the remote, `origin`
- `git pull origin main`: bring down the `main` branch from the remote `origin`

- `git switch -c BRANCH_NAME`: create and "switch" you to the BRANCH_NAME
